1️⃣ Deep Learning-Based Approaches
These methods use neural networks to extract features from faces and classify them.

(a) Embedding Matching (FaceNet, ArcFace, DeepFace, etc.) ✅
Converts faces into 128/512-dimensional vectors and compares distances.
Used in FaceNet, ArcFace, DeepFace, and Dlib’s face recognition models.
✅ Pros: Highly accurate, handles variations in lighting, pose, and expressions.
❌ Cons: Needs a good pre-trained model and high-quality images.

(b) CNN-based Classification 🧠
Instead of comparing embeddings, train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify faces into known categories.
Model predicts which student the face belongs to.
✅ Pros: Works well when trained on a large dataset.
❌ Cons: Requires training a model with labeled data for every new student.

Example Models:

ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNet trained on face datasets like CelebA, LFW.


3️⃣ Hybrid Approaches
Some modern systems combine deep learning and traditional ML for better accuracy.

(a) Siamese Networks (One-shot Learning) 🏆
Instead of training for all students, it learns to compare pairs of faces.
Useful for cases where new faces frequently appear.
✅ Pros: Works with very few training images.
❌ Cons: Training is slow and computationally expensive.

📌 Used in: OpenFace, DeepFace
